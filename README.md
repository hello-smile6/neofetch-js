Neofetch for the web. If you'd like to contribute but don't have Git installed or don't want to use it, you can always use [github.dev](https://github.dev/hello-smile6/neofetch-js). PLEASE don't use the Github web editor, it doesn't work very well and creates too many commits.

> Note: PRs and issues may be closed if they implement/request something that [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch)'s maintainer has rejected. However, features specific to the web are certainly welcome. Please make sure everything works outside of the browser when possible, and open an issue if you find something that doesn't work in Node.

## Formatting
Please don't format the icons. Disable your formatter's "Format on save" feature, and never use a CLI formatter unless you've blacklisted the icons with it. If you format the icons, it'll end up like [#9 (Comment)](https://github.com/hello-smile6/neofetch-js/pull/9#issuecomment-1053123272). Let's avoid that.
# How to get neofetch
```
npm i -g neofetch
```
Or:
```
npx neofetch
```
Use `--ascii_distro` to set what logo you get and use `--logo` to get only the logo.
